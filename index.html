      We all want motivation in life, whenever we feel down we need something
      that triggers our emotions and gives us the motivation to do our work or
      take action towards our goals. That's why to get real-time motivation or
      clarity in life we should understand the life lessons from Bhagavad Gita,
      which is considered the greatest scripture of all time. Bhagavad Gita is
      not just scripture written by a saint, it is actually the real
      conversation between Lord Krishna and his best friend or disciple Prince
      Arjun. On the battlefield when Arjun got demotivated, he was not ready to
      do war, he was unhappy about his decision of war against family members,
      at that time Lord Krishna told the Bhagavad Gita to Arjun. Bhagavad Gita
      gave in-depth clarity to arjuna about his purpose in life,
      self-realization, what is right/ wrong as per Dharma, who we are, and what
      is karma, etc. Because of which he performed his duty under the guidance
      of the supreme god Lord Krishna without any demotivation. It's difficult
      to cover all the lessons of Bhagavad Gita in one article. But I will try
      my best to give you 5 important Life lessons from Bhagavad Gita in this
      article, that will give you more clarity as well as motivation in life to
      find your true purpose and achieve your goals. So let's start...
    </p>
    <ol>
      <h2>
        <li>
          Bad situations come by not doing anything, but to create a good
          situation, you have to take action -
        </li>
      </h2>

      </div>
      <p>
        As per Bhagavad Gita, if you want to achieve something in life but
        instead of taking action towards it, if you put that responsibility on
        God or on your luck, you think that God should save me in every
        situation and help me achieve my goals without any effort then with this
        type of thought process you will always get the worst results and
        failures. It's just like you don't have to do anything to be dirty, just
        sit and you will be dirty but to get clean you have to take action, you
        have to go to the bathroom and take a shower. This is because our body
        is constantly fighting with the disorders of the world. And the person
        who becomes inactive in this fight keeps on losing in every aspect of
        his life. You only win in life or conquer any challenge in life if you
        are ready to take action and ready to give your 100% effort in that
        process. To convert all bad situations of life into good situations, you
        must have to take action. So start taking action towards your goals now.
        This is one of the most important lessons of the Bhagavad Gita.
      </p>
      <h2>
        <li>
          Change is a universal law, that's why every happiness or sorrow is
          temporary -
        </li>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Change is the only constant in life. Everything in this world is
        continuously changing, every minute of every hour of every day, change
        is always occurring, whether you like it or not. So the best way to
        handle changes is to not run away from them. You should face it, prepare
        yourself for that change and make the best of it. In Bhagavad Gita, Lord
        Krishna advises Arjun that- <br />
      </p>
      <p class="bold">
        "Your senses create sensations like cold, heat, happiness, sadness or
        stress in you by coming in contact with the things that are heard,
        smelled, tasted or felt. These feelings are temporary. It goes away as
        it comes. So Arjun you learn to tolerate these changes."
      </p>
      <h2><li>Keep your focus on your duty, not on the end result-</li></h2>

        This lesson talks about goal setting, like how most people decide what
        they want to achieve in life. But still, they are never able to cross
        the obstacles or distractions that come in their way of reaching the
        goal. There was a great story from Mahabharata which emphasizes this
        particular lesson. In the Mahabharata, Dronacharya, who used to be
        Arjuna's guru, when he is teaching archery to all his students, tells
        him that he has to aim at the eye of a wooden bird placed on a tree.
        Then he asks everyone what he is seeing on the tree, at that time
        someone says that he is able to see the bird sitting on the tree, then
        someone tells him the whole tree, the bird sitting on it, its wings, its
        eyes, everything is visible. But when Guru Dronacharya asked Arjuna,
        Arjun said that "I can see only the bird's eye and nothing else". Just
        like this, we will find many obstacles and distractions in the way of
        our goal which will divert our focus towards unimportant things. That's
        why you have to put your attention in your work with full enthusiasm
        that you do not see anything else. Whatever work you are doing right now
        just focus on the process and give your 100% in that and then leave the
        responsibility of result on god. So, among the 10 powerful lessons of
        Bhagavad Gita, this lesson highlights the importance of focusing on the
        process of achieving any goal in life.

      <h2><li>You become what you believe in yourself -</li></h2>
      <div>
        <img src="./belief.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Belief is the world's most powerful thing or we can say a feeling.
        Because it can heal a sick person, make a sad person happy, and can make
        a failed person progress. With belief, we can achieve anything in life.
        Every great person first convinces his mind that he is worth doing
        something big, he can do something big in his life. Only then does he
        have the courage to actually do that thing and once he has that courage
        he can achieve all his goals.
      </p>
      <h2><li>Cowardice and fear are the enemies of success -</li></h2>
      <div>
        <img src="./eliminatefear.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The 5th lesson of Bhagavad Gita focuses on two enemies of success ie.
        cowardice and fear. Because fear is one of our oldest feelings that make
        us doubt our ability and this feeling comes out when we do not fully
        understand the situation either because of lack of knowledge. Or due to
        the inability to manage our emotions. This fear makes us cowards and
        deviates us from our goals. So you should pursue more knowledge and
        wisdom as these are the two things that will teach you how to handle
        unknown and unexpected situations in life.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">Knowledge and Wisdom destroy fear completely.</p>
